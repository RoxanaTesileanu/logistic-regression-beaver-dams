This is the Rproj of the statistical analysis on the occurence of beaver dams in 7 selected stream landscapes located in Romania.
The sampling design was inspired from the work of Darryl MacKnezie on occupancy models. The statistical analysis is however not that complex, due to the fact that the present study doesn't have to deal with imperfect detection. Thus, the statistical analysis is based mainly on logistic regression.
